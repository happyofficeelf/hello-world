# hello-world

Greetings,

Welcome to my first Hello World and Repository both.

Happy Office Elf was a knickname from way back that I liked because it gave me an excuse to tie bells to my shoelaces.
No relation to Middle Earth elves; melodrama is fun in doses, but I can't be that serious ALL the time :)
